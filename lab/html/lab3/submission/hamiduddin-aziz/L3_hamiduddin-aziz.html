	<p> <b> LANGLEY, VA — </b> A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has
	mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>

	<p> According to the report, sections of the documents — <i> "almost invariably the most crucial passages"</i>— are marred by an
	indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at
	the agency's inception in 1947.</p>

	<p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several
        historic events, such as:<br>
        <ul> 
        <li>the Cold War</li> 
        <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
        <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
        </ul>
    
        </p>
